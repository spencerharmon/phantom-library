## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **M10 — Phantom symlink library + visibility fix.** Phantoms are
  now backed by per-item symlinks under a plugin-owned writable root
  (default `/var/lib/jellyfin/phantom-library/{movies,shows}`) and
  bound into the operator's existing `gostream-movies` /
  `gostream-shows` libraries via a new
  `PhantomCollectionFolderBinder`. Restores browse visibility for
  Suggestions / SeriesIngestor rows that were invisible in v0.1
  because `Path = null` caused the scanner to cull them. New config
  knobs: `PhantomStubRoot`, `PhantomMoviesLibraryName`,
  `PhantomShowsLibraryName`. New operator install step: `sudo mkdir
  -p /var/lib/jellyfin/phantom-library/{movies,shows} && sudo chown
  -R jellyfin:jellyfin /var/lib/jellyfin/phantom-library`. Includes
  a documented workaround for an upstream Jellyfin bug in
  `LibraryStructureController.AddMediaPath` (does not refresh the
  `CollectionFolder`'s `PhysicalLocationsList` /
  `PhysicalFolderIds`); upstream PR tracked separately. The
  workaround is hardened against the Jellyfin metadata-saver
  race via three layers (verify-from-repository loop,
  `ItemUpdated` event watchdog, periodic re-bind every 5 min);
  end-to-end verified that both `gostream-movies` and
  `gostream-shows` bindings persist across multiple
  metadata-refresh cycles.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-04

Initial release. Movies + series + materialisation + splash hand-off +
suggestions + eviction + series autopilot. Targets Jellyfin 10.11.x
(`targetAbi: 10.11.0.0`, `net9.0`).

### Added

- **M1 — gostream `POST /api/library/add`** (`e4df693` on gostream
  branch `phantom-library/api-add`). One-shot torrent-registration +
  FUSE-path-return endpoint; the contract Phantom Library calls into.
- **M2 — Plugin skeleton, configuration, packaging** (`bbe5dbf`).
  `Plugin` entry point, `PluginConfiguration`, JPRM-compatible
  `build.yaml`, manifest stub, GitHub Actions build + release
  workflows.
- **M3 — TMDB client, remote search providers, image provider,
  virtual item factory** (`e837cd1`). Movie + Series remote search
  feeding Jellyfin's "Identify" / search flow, with TMDB images
  surfaced through the standard `IRemoteImageProvider` path.
- **M4 — Materialisation pipeline** (`2451075`). Prowlarr (primary) +
  Torrentio (fallback) indexer clients, `QualityScorer` mirroring
  gostream's scorer, bounded materialisation queue, gostream client
  calling `/api/library/add` and polling for the FUSE path.
- **M5 — Fake play button + static splash hand-off** (`8ca2f8b`).
  Splash `MediaSource` served as opaque pixels; pressing play on a
  Virtual item enqueues materialisation and hands the client the
  splash; per-item status surfaced via overview-text prefix (see
  *Known limitations*).
- **M6 — Suggestions integration** (`abe0fd1`). TMDB Trending /
  Similar / Recommended folded into Jellyfin's suggestion rows;
  `tmdb_cache` with TTL tuning (default 6h trending, 24h
  similar+recs) to stay inside TMDB rate limits.
- **M6.5 — gostream Vault Mode** (`109c856` on gostream branch
  `phantom-library/vault-mode`). `persist=true` stub flag for
  per-stub full-file SSD cache; the plugin writes this opportunistically
  when the patch is detected at runtime.
- **M7 — Eviction sweeper + favourite-driven persistence** (`3377add`).
  Default 7-idle-days eviction; favourited items protected per-user
  via the admin-page user-prefs form (see *Known limitations*); Vault
  Mode persist flag set on favourites when the gostream patch is
  available.
- **M8 — TV series + autopilot** (`60de538`). Series remote search
  promoted to MVP; next-episode prefetch for series a user is
  actively watching; direct-sequel prefetch for finished movies.
- **M9 — Packaging + release polish** (this release). Troubleshooting
  README section drawn from real M2/M5 install failures, concrete
  Linux install worked example, mascot SVG/PNG, CHANGELOG, PLAN.md
  status table.

### Fixed (during M5 testing, pre-tag)

- `f6e70b7` — admin config page sent enum values as ints; Jellyfin's
  XML serializer expects enum *names*. Page would spin on save.
- `5595103` — `IApplicationPaths` resolved at registration time
  (`IServerApplicationHost.Resolve`) threw `ArgumentNullException`
  because the host isn't fully constructed yet; deferred resolution
  to a DI factory closure.
- `3a1e413` — retargeted to Jellyfin 10.11.9 / `net9.0` after the
  operator's running instance turned out to be 10.11.x rather than
  10.10.x.

### Companion gostream branches

- `phantom-library/api-add` (M1, `e4df693`) — required for any
  materialisation to work; v0.1 hard depends on it.
- `phantom-library/vault-mode` (M6.5, `109c856`) — optional;
  plugin detects at runtime and degrades gracefully if absent.

### Known limitations / partials

- **Custom QualityPreset falls back to GostreamDefault** with a
  warning log. The selector is wired through, but no custom-scorer
  use case has surfaced yet; revisit when one does.
- **Per-user preferences via admin sub-page form**, not native
  Jellyfin user-prefs integration. Functional but not idiomatic;
  proper integration is v0.2 polish.
- **Series-level `Materialise` returns `Error`** by design. A Series
  is a container, not a streamable file; materialise individual
  Episodes (autopilot does this for the next unwatched one
  automatically).
- **Splash overlay is static pixels.** Dynamic per-item status text
  would require a per-request ffmpeg transcoder; v0.1 surfaces
  status via Jellyfin's native item fields (overview-text prefix
  rendered by the client UI).
